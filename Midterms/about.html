We were allowed to use electronic signatures from Michigan to Wisconsin and that saved us a great deal of money and travel time. <mark>The whole experience was a pleasure</mark> thanks to Brad. He knew every question that we had about the transaction. And he also was very helpful after our purchase with a person to contact because our four season room had a leak by the skylight. It was repaired immediately. Definitely would recommend him!!!"</em><small>-Terry</small></p>
